  <h1 class="mt-4">Overview</h1>

  <p class="mt-4">

  Few programs anywhere in the country that can compete with Pitt’s Audiology curriculum. Ranked 6th in the nation, our solid reputation comes from a strong emphasis on evidence-based instruction and extensive clinical exposure from day one in the program.
</p>

<p>
  At Pitt, students have the unique opportunity to engage in exceptional research experiences, working alongside renowned faculty members who are leaders in audiology and hearing science. This hands-on research involvement allows students to contribute directly to the growing body of evidence in audiology, making significant contributions to the field while developing their own research skills. These experiences are supported by a robust and unique research environment within the larger Pittsburgh community, featuring thirteen principal investigators at the University of Pittsburgh and Carnegie Mellon University (located within a mile of each other) are leaders in cross-disciplinary, bench-to-bedside biomedical research focused on auditory neuroscience.
</p>
<p>
  The University of Pittsburgh is ranked the top public school in the northeastern US (WSJ/THE rankings) and ranks 5th among US schools in NIH funding. Pitt School of Health and Rehabilitation Sciences (SHRS) has as its core mission “to advance health and rehabilitation through research, teaching, and professional service,” promoting excellence, impact, and innovation as well as full participation of persons with disabilities in a multidisciplinary community of academic programs and inclusion of all people regardless of race, culture, gender, age, ethnicity, socio-economic experience, ability, disability, religion, gender identity and expression or sexual orientation. Explicit goals of SHRS’s strategic plan, are to enrich the student experience with transformative opportunities to learn, grow and thrive, create more individualized research, teaching, learning, and scholarship experiences, and enhance the professional trajectories and personal success of our alumni. The Department of Communication Science and Disorders (CSD) administers the # 7 ranked Doctor of Audiology (AuD) program. Pitt’s AuD program has successfully trained graduates over several decades. The strength of the department is evidenced by alumni who are international leaders in the field of CSD and the biomedical workforce.

  <!--
  The list of notable alumni includes Charles Berlin, PhD Professor Emeritus Otorhinolaryngology, Head and Neck Surgery, and Physiology and former Director of the world-renowned Kresge Hearing Research Laboratory in New Orleans, LA; Jack Katz, PhD editor of the most widely used Audiology text book and internationally recognized leader in auditory processing disorder assessment and treatment, O’neil Guthrie, PhD current director of the Cell and Molecular Pathology Laboratory and North Arizona University which focuses on the cellular and molecular bases of disease as a necessary prerequisite to the development of biomedical therapies, and Annette Mazevski, AuD, PhD Manager of Technology Assessment, Oticon. Our graduates also are leaders in industry including Sheneekra Adams, AuD Director of Professional Development at WS Audiology and Sheena Oliver, Chief Marketing Officer at WS Audiology. In addition, our graduates are leaders in education including Amanda Ortmann, PhD, Director of the graduate Audiology program at Washington University, St. Louis, MO, Lindsey Jorgensen, PhD, Chair of Speech and Hearing, University of South Dakota, and Reem Mulla, PhD, Vice Dean of Academic Affairs, College of Health and Rehabilitation Sciences, Princess Nourah Bint Abdulrahman University.  Four of these individuals are URM and all the women would be considered under-represented in leadership positions. Building on a strong historical legacy, we have experienced a tremendous recent growth in our AuD program (applicants increased by 60% in the last 3 years), including 5 new faculty hires and the creation of 8 academic, clinical and research staff positions since 2019. At the same time, Pitt CSD also has increased submission and successes in F31 and F32 fellowship awards and federal research grants from $750K in 2019 to $16M in 2022. Of particular relevance to TRANSLATES participants, we have invested in significant facilities renovations (in 2019) that includes a multi-investigator lab initiative that dismantle traditional silos and promote greater team-based scientific collaborations and translation. The Brain and Auditory Sciences Research Initiative (BASRI) serves as an incubator for innovative team-based research, intensive research, and cross-training experiences in auditory neuroscience. BASRI will provide workspace for TRANSLATES participants, allowing seamless interactions between participants and predoctoral/postdoctoral scholars currently funded by NIDCD research and training grants.
